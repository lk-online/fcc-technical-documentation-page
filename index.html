            <p>HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation
                of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated
                by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different
                sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.</p>
            <p>HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these simple messages are encapsulated in
                frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle remains the same. For example:
                <code>GET / HTTP/1.1
                    Host: developer.mozilla.org
                    Accept-Language: fr</code>
            </p>
            <p>If HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without waiting for the first response to
                be fully received. HTTP pipelining has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old
                pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has been superseded in HTTP/2 with more
                robust multiplexing requests within a frame.</p>

                <h2>HTTP Cache</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. When a
                web cache has a requested resource in its store, it intercepts the request and returns its copy instead
                of re-downloading from the originating server. This achieves several goals: it eases the load of the
                server that doesn’t need to serve all clients itself, and it improves performance by being closer to the
                client, i.e., it takes less time to transmit the resource back. For a web site, it is a major component
                in achieving high performance. On the other side, it has to be configured properly as not all resources
                stay identical forever: it is important to cache a resource only until it changes, not longer.</p>
            <p>There are several kinds of caches: these can be grouped into two main categories: private or shared
                caches. A shared cache is a cache that stores responses for reuse by more than one user. A private cache
                is dedicated to a single user. This page will mostly talk about browser and proxy caches, but there are
                also gateway caches, CDN, reverse proxy caches and load balancers that are deployed on web servers for
                better reliability, performance and scaling of web sites and web applications.
            </p>
            <p>HTTP caching is optional, but reusing a cached resource is usually desirable. However, common HTTP caches
                are typically limited to caching responses to GET and may decline other methods. The primary cache key
                consists of the request method and target URI (oftentimes only the URI is used as only GET requests are
                caching targets). Common forms of caching entries are:
            <ul>
                <li>Successful results of a retrieval request: a <code>200</code> (OK) response to a GET request
                    containing a resource like HTML documents, images or files.</li>
                <li>Permanent redirects: a <code>301</code> (Moved Permanently) response.</li>
                <li>Error responses: a <code>404</code> (Not Found) result page.</li>
                <li>Incomplete results: a <code>206</code> (Partial Content) response.</li>
                <li>Responses other than <code>GET</code> if something suitable for use as a cache key is defined.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                <h2>HTTP Cookies</h2>
            </header>
            <p>An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's
                web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server.
                Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser — keeping a user logged-in, for
                example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.</p>
            <p>Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>Session management
                    Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember</li>
                <li>Personalization
                    User preferences, themes, and other settings</li>
                <li>Tracking
                    Recording and analyzing user behavior</li>

                <h2>HTTP Headers</h2>
            </header>
            <p>HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.
                An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value.
                Whitespace before the value is ignored.</p>
            <p>Custom proprietary headers have historically been used with an X- prefix, but this convention was
                deprecated in June 2012 because of the inconveniences it caused when nonstandard fields became standard
                in RFC 6648; others are listed in an IANA registry, whose original content was defined in RFC 4229. IANA
                also maintains a registry of proposed new HTTP headers.</p>
            <p>Headers can also be grouped according to how proxies handle them:
            <ul>
                <li><code>Connection</code></li>
                <li><code>Keep-Alive</code></li>
                <li><code>Proxy-Authenticate</code></li>
                <li><code>Proxy-Authorization</code></li>
                <li><code>TE</code></li>
                <li><code>Trailer</code></li>
                <li><code>Transfer-Encoding</code></li>
                <li><code>Upgrade</code></li>

                <h2>HTTP Request Methods</h2>
            </header>
            <p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given
                resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP
                verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of
                them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>GET</code> method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET
                    should only retrieve data.</li>
                <li>The <code>HEAD</code> method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the
                    response body.</li>
                <li>The <code>POST</code> method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a
                    change in state or side effects on the server.</li>
                <li>The <code>PUT</code> method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the
                    request payload.</li>
                <li>The <code>DELETE</code> method deletes the specified resource.</li>
                <li>The <code>CONNECT</code> method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target
                    resource.</li>
                <li>The <code>OPTIONS</code> method is used to describe the communication options for the target
                    resource.</li>
                <li>The <code>TRACE</code> method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target
                    resource.</li>
                <li>The <code>PATCH</code> method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.
                Responses are grouped in five classes:

                <li>Informational responses (100–199)</li>
                <li>Successful responses (200–299)</li>
                <li>Redirects (300–399)</li>
                <li>Client errors (400–499)</li>
                <li>and Server errors (500–599)</li>

            <p>The HTTP <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> response header allows web site administrators to control
                resources the
                user agent is allowed to load for a given page. With a few exceptions, policies mostly involve
                specifying server origins and script endpoints. This helps guard against cross-site scripting attacks
                (XSS).</p>
